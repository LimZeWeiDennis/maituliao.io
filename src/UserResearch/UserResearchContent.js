                        methods were employed to study and understand the mindset and strategies of our users. We have

                        In our contextual inquiry, we recruited 3 interviewees respectively to conduct a
                        semi-structured interview. The sampling method we chose for our interviewees was &nbsp;

                    <text className='contentText'>
                        During the interview, interviewees were asked a series of questions regarding their
                        shopping routine, type of shopper they consider themselves, potential and visible issues they
                        faced while shopping, their perspectives of how they find their essential and/or new products
                        in the supermarket, their experience with fast or slow shopping. Through allowing the users to
                        elaborate freely with their responses, we can eliminate any of our existing biases and this allows
                        us to gain a more holistic insight into the problem.

                        supermarket environment. Based on their
                        responses and our observations, we are then able to better identify the prevalent pain points,
                        faced by both experienced and inexperienced supermarket shoppers, as well as to set the direction
                        for our research.

                        For the survey, we recruited participants by sharing it through our friends,
                        family and relatives that we felt were part of the identified target user groups and potential
                        interviewees. As such, we gathered a total of 57 respondents that proceeded with the survey. Our
                        respondents were asked the following survey questions such as: time taken to shop at the
                        supermarket, type of shopper and the challenges faced in grocery shopping. A survey-based
                        method allows us to have greater outreach in a short period of time, allowing us to gain a
                        more representative set of data to help clarify any form of misconceptions, stereotypes and
                        doubts that we had prior to the research.
